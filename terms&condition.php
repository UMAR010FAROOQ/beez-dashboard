<p>“Customer” includes the consignor, shipper, consignee, owner of the Goods, and any person lawfully acting on behalf of any of those persons.</p>
<p>“Goods” means articles of every kind and description, including their packaging, containers, or other shipping units or materials, as to which Customer desires for Beez Logistics to perform or arrange Services.</p>
<p>“Person” means any natural person, firm, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or any other legal entity.</p>

<li><strong>AGREEMENT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>By Customer’s request to Beez Logistics for Services, Customer agrees to these Terms and Conditions, which no agent or employee of the parties may alter.By tendering a shipment to Beez Logistics, Shipper agrees to all of the terms and conditions set forth below and to any rates (including fees, charges, and surcharges). This Agreement supersedes and negates any claimed, alleged, or asserted oral or written contract, promise, representation, or understanding between the parties except with respect to any written agreement that expressly references and supersedes this Agreement which other agreement is signed by an authorized representative of both parties after the effective date of this Agreement. If the cargo is tendered pursuant to any bill of lading or air waybill or any other shipping document, this Agreement will govern in the event of a dispute between this Agreement and such document except to the extent otherwise mandated by compulsorily applicable law. This Agreement may be modified only by written amendment signed by both Shipper and an officer of Beez Logistics. Shipper hereby acknowledges and agrees that Beez Logistics, as a freight forwarder or property broker, may subcontract with underlying service providers in order to arrange for transportation under this Agreement. Shipper consents to all such instances of subcontracting. Any subcontractor used by Beez Logistics to perform any services under this Agreement including, but not limited to, any carriage covered by a bill of lading, air waybill or similar document, will be entitled to all limitations and exclusions to and from liability and all other protections to which Beez Logistics is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Shipper acknowledges and agrees that when Beez Logistics arranges for all-ground transportation by motor carrier, Beez Logistics shall be deemed to be operating as a property broker and not a freight forwarder. Customer understands and agrees that when Beez Logistics is a Title 49 property broker with such operating authority from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration—docket number MC541163.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>CUSTOMER’S RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></li>

Customer shall furnish such information and complete and attach to the air waybill or other shipping documents such documents as are necessary to comply with such laws. Customer shall ensure that each package is accurately and completely described on the shipping document, is properly marked and addressed, is packaged adequately to protect the enclosed Goods to ensure safe transportation with ordinary care in handling, and, except as noted in writing, is in good order and condition. If Customer wishes to tender Goods requiring special care or handling, including shipments requiring temperature control, then Customer must give written notice to Beez Logistics of such requirements and must obtain the written agreement of Beez Logistics to comply with such instructions before Customer’s tender of Goods for such Services. Beez Logistics shall have no obligation to comply with any special handling instructions unless Beez Logistics expressly agrees in writing before performing or arranging such Services. For Goods requiring temperature control, Customer shall provide Beez Logistics with appropriate temperature ranges and shall ensure that the Goods are at the appropriate temperature at the time of tender. Beez Logistics’ sole obligation as to requests for temperature-controlled service shall be to arrange for transportation in cargo holds or containers that are set within appropriate temperature ranges. In no event shall Beez Logistics have any responsibility for the packaging of such Goods and shall have no obligation to open any packaging or otherwise ensure that the contents or temperatures of any package Customer tenders remain within appropriate ranges. Beez Logistics shall have no duty to remove or replace any cold packs or other devices included in shipment packaging for the purpose of maintaining approved temperature ranges. Customer understands and agrees that Beez Logistics may reject, abandon, or release any Goods consigned to Beez Logistics that it has declared to be unacceptable or that Customer has undervalued for customs purposes or misdescribed on the shipping documents, whether intentionally or otherwise, without incurring any liability to Customer. Customer agrees to indemnify and defend Beez Logistics from all claims, damages, fines, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys; fees, arising from a failure to comply with this section.</p>

Parts 171, 172, and 173), the current edition of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations (together “Regulations”) and any other rules and regulations applicable to such shipments. Customer and its agents shall comply with the Regulations regardless of the Goods routing or mode of transportation. Each shipment requiring a Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods under the Regulations shall be accompanied by properly executed documents in conformance with the requirements of the Regulations. If a shipment contains hazardous materials/dangerous goods, then the Goods shall be – and Customer certifies that they are – fully and accurately described on the air waybill or other shipping document by proper shipping name and are classified, packaged, marked, and labeled, and in proper condition for carriage by air (or, if tendered for other mode of transportation, then for carriage by such other mode) according to the Regulations and any other applicable national governmental regulations. Customer declares that all of the applicable air transport requirements have been met.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>CARGO SECURITY AND CONSENT TO INSPECT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Customer understands and agrees that Beez Logistics, like all indirect air carriers, is required by the federal Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) to maintain an air cargo security program. If Customer is acting as an agent, authorized representative, broker, carrier, or other freight intermediary for any other Person, Customer shall disclose that to Beez Logistics and shall assist Beez Logistics in complying with the TSA requirements by enabling Beez Logistics to obtain any necessary documents from, or otherwise qualify, such other Person. As required by TSA regulations (49 C.F.R. § 1548.9(b)), Customer consents to an inspection of all Goods.</p>

<li><strong>MAXIMUM LIABILITY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Customer understands and agrees that in any event, a cap of $100,000 applies to Beez Logistics’ liability.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>LIABILITIES NOT ASSUMED</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>(a) Beez LOGISTICS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE for Customer’ acts or omissions, including improper packing, securing, marking, or addressing; loss or damage to Goods not acceptable for transport or prohibited items; loss, damage, or delay caused by events Beez Logistics cannot control, including electrical or magnetic injury, erasure, acts of God; public authorities acting with actual or apparent authority; strikes; labor disputes; weather; mechanical failures; aircraft failures; unavailability, in whole or in part, of fuel; civil commotions; acts or omissions of customs or quarantine officials; the nature of the freight or any of its defects; public enemies; hazards incident to a state of war; acts of terrorism; and by acts, defaults, or omissions of Customer under these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>(b) Beez LOGISTICS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE for consequences of failure to pick-up, transport, or deliver any Goods by a specific date or a specific time, regardless of the cause of such delay.</p>
<p>(c) Beez LOGISTICS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING AS TO LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, UTILITY, INTEREST, OR LOSS OF MARKET, WHETHER OR NOT Beez LOGISTICS HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH DAMAGE MIGHT OCCUR.</p>
<p>(d) Beez LOGISTICS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE in any event for damage to electronic or photographic images or recordings in any form.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>CLAIMS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The following provisions apply to all claims for loss, damage, delay, or shortage:</p>
<p>(a) Air Shipments. Customer shall give Beez Logistics notice for any damage, shortage or loss in writing within 14 days after delivery of the shipment or, for delay within 21 days of the day of tender.</p>
<p>(b) Ocean Shipments. Customer shall give Beez Logistics written notice of any claim for damage, shortage, or loss in writing within three days after the delivery of the shipment to consignee. If Customer or any Person other than Beez Logistics arranges for the Goods to be picked up at the port, notice of claim shall be given within three days from the date such carrier, warehouse, or other Person takes possession of the Goods at the port.</p>
<p>(c) Truck Shipments. Customer shall give Beez Logistics notice of any damage, shortage, or loss in writing within 30 days after delivery of the Goods or, for delay, within 45 days of the day of tender.</p>
<p>(d) Notice of Claim. The notice of claim shall include complete consignor and consignee information, the air waybill, bill of lading, or shipment reference number, the date of the shipment, the number of the pieces, and the shipment’s weight. Customer understands and agrees that the consequence of its failure to provide a timely written notice of claim is that Customer’s action against Beez Logistics will be barred.</p>
<p>Beez Logistics is not obligated to process any claim until Customer has paid all Charges as to the Goods at issue. Customer understands and agrees that it has no right to deduct and it shall not deduct a claim amount from any Charges or from any outstanding balance owed Beez Logistics without the prior written approval of Beez Logistics. Customer shall retain and make available for Beez Logistics’ inspection All original shipping containers, packages, and contents. Except as these Terms and Conditions state otherwise, the receipt of the Goods by the consignee without written notice of damage on the waybill or delivery receipt shall be construed as prima facie evidence that the Goods were delivered in good condition.</p>
<p>For claims involving concealed damage not discovered at the time of delivery, Customer or consignee shall notify Beez Logistics as promptly as possible after the discovery of the damage, and in any event, not less than 7 days after the date of delivery. Customer’s failure to provide such notice shall result in a presumption that the loss or damage so noted occurred subsequent to delivery, which presumption may only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Under no circumstances shall Beez Logistics be liable for loss of or damage to external shipping containers used in the transportation of the Goods. Failure of Customer to comply with the notice provisions shall bar any lawsuit against Beez Logistics.</p>
<ol start="13">

</ol>
<p>Unless otherwise expressly provided in a separate written agreement signed by both Customer and an officer of Beez Logistics, and subject to any conditions or restrictions in such writing, the following articles shall not be accepted for carriage: any shipment prohibited by law; blood, urine, bodily fluids, and other diagnostic specimens; firearms; fireworks; tobacco products; plants and plant materials; fragile items; live animals; animal remains; shipments requiring special licenses for their transportation; original works of art; antiques; bonds; collectible stamps; coins of any kind; currency; currency equivalents; furs; fur clothing; gems or stones (cut or uncut); industrial diamonds; gold or silver jewelry; pearls; precious metals; negotiable securities; time-sensitive written material (such as: contract bids; proposals; when the declared value exceeds U.S. $0.50 per pound); household goods or personal effects; one-of-a-kind articles or models, Prototypes; and anything with an unusual or extraordinary value.

Beez Logistics reserves the right to reject any shipment for any reason, including because of safety or security concerns. The value of shipments involving documents, records, and data records, without limitation as to the type, including electronic or paper hard copy, shall be limited to the value of the actual media upon which it is contained. As such, electronic records will be considered of no greater value than the lesser of the cost to repair, cost to replace, actual value, released value or declared value of the tape, disc, or other media being transported. Further, no costs, expenses, or claims of any nature will be assumed or accepted for the replication, duplication or recreation of lost data. In the case of paper documents, the value shall be limited to the value of the paper without reference to any legal rights or obligations evidenced in such documents. The above limitations shall apply regardless of declarations made or documentation on any shipment paperwork.</p>

Unless inserted otherwise on the front page of the shipping document, the C.O.D. amount of the shipment shall be deemed to be the declared value for carriage amount. This declared value for carriage amount in excess of the limits of liability under section 6 of these Terms and Conditions shall be subject to an excess valuation charge.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li><strong>SUBSTITUTION OF ROUTING, MODE, CARRIER, OR EQUIPMENT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Customer authorizes Beez Logistics to select any shipment routing, alternative carrier, alternative mode of transport, or equipment regardless of what the shipping documents state, for any reason, to attempt to meet the service level Customer has requested, including any express motor carrier or other company to transport such shipment, and Beez Logistics’ obligation is limited to delivery of Customer’s shipment to any such company. Transportation by air of any shipment is subject to availability of equipment and space.</p>

<li><strong>PRICING AND ACTUAL/DIMENSIONAL WEIGHT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Rates and charges for the carriage of the shipment by Beez Logistics shall be as established by separate agreement orally or in writing by the parties prior to shipment and shall be based on actual or dimensional weight, whichever is greater.

<ol start="18">
<li><strong>LOSS, DAMAGE, OR EXPENSE DUE TO DELAY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unless the Services are delayed by reason of the negligence or other fault of Beez Logistics, it shall have no liability for any loss, damage, or expense Customer may incur or pay because of such delay. If Beez Logistics were to cause a delay because of its negligence or other fault, then Beez Logistics’ liability shall nevertheless be limited under sections 6 and 7 of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li><strong>INTEREST AND FEES ON PAST DUE ACCOUNTS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Customer agrees to pay interest of 1.5% per month that accrues on the past-due principal, plus collection costs added to the principal and accrued interest, plus attorneys’ fees added to the principal, accrued interest, and collection costs.&nbsp; If Beez Logistics files suit, a suit fee applies and Beez Logistics shall be entitled to reimbursement of all of its court costs.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li><strong>LIEN RIGHTS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Beez Logistics shall have a general lien on all documents and shipments of Customer in Beez Logistics’ actual or constructive possession or control for monies owed to Beez Logistics with regard to the shipment on which the lien is claimed, prior shipment(s), or both. In the event, Beez Logistics exercises its lien, it shall notify Customer of the exact amount of monies due from Customer. Beez Logistics shall also notify Customer of all other Charges accruing on shipments subject to Beez Logistics’ lien. Beez Logistics shall release its lien upon receipt of payment by Customer of the total amount due. If Customer does not pay Beez Logistics’ lien within fifteen (15) calendar days of Beez Logistics’ exercise of the lien, then Beez Logistics shall have the right, but not the obligation, to sell such shipment(s) at public or private sale or auction without further notice to Customer.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li><strong>SEVERABILITY; NON-WAIVER</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of the Terms and Conditions shall be unaffected and remain in effect. No waiver by any party of any breach or default under these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or default under these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li><strong>TIME FOR SUIT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Customer understands and agrees that Beez Logistics shall be discharged from all liability to Customer as to any Carriage or Services that the Broker has provided or arranged unless Customer files an action in the mandatory venue under section 25 within one year after the date of delivery of the Goods or from the date on which the Goods should have been delivered. If that one-year time-bar is contrary to any compulsorily applicable law, then the limitations period of such law will apply. If Beez Logistics were to prevail in any legal action connected with the Carriage, Services, or Goods, then Beez Logistics will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li><strong>MANDATORY LAW, VENUE, AND JURISDICTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All claims or disputes arising out of or in any way related to these Terms and Conditions shall be determined under the federal law of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of laws rules or, in the absence of such federal law, then under the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Without prejudice to a party’s right to remove an action to federal court, the exclusive and mandatory venue for any such claims or disputes shall be the federal or state courts in King County, Washington, to the exclusion of all other courts. The parties agree to irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts and to waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to those courts.</p>
